Context Provides Genuine Cues in Minority of Cases\n","\n","Only a **small subset** of examples show genuine context-dependent sarcasm:\n","\n","**Example 4 (context helps):**\n","- Parent: \"Parents choose to have kids (usually), kids don't choose parents that have zero savings at 65\"\n","- Reply: \"Parents usually don't 'choose' kids with congenital diseases as well...\"\n","- Analysis: The sarcastic contradiction directly references the parent's \"choose\" language\n","\n","**Example 11 (context helps):**\n","- Parent: \"If you don't believe that, are you consistent and believe cops should be disarmed as well?\"\n","- Reply: \"But cops have training!\"\n","- Analysis: Sarcastic agreement that mocks the parent's implied argument\n","\n","**Example 20 (context helps):**\n","- Parent: \"If you threaten my life, I instantly hold zero concern for your life\"\n","- Reply: \"Because getting into a shootout has no impact whatsoever on your own life\"\n","- Analysis: Sarcastic response pointing out the logical flaw in parent's statement\n","\n","**Estimate:** Approximately 15-25% of examples benefit meaningfully from context.\n","\n","---\n","##### 3.

Emotion Signals Are Weak\n","**Dominant emotion is \"neutral\" for 66% of sarcastic comments**:\n","- Most sarcasm is emotionally flat/deadpan in text\n","- Only 15% show \"surprise\" (second highest)\n","- Negative emotions (anger, disgust) account for ~26% combined\n","\n","#### 3. Limited Discriminative Power\n","**Sentiment distributions are similar between sarcastic and non-sarcastic**:\n","- Both are ~50% neutral\n","- Difference in negative: 46% vs 33% (only 13% gap)\n","- This suggests sentiment/emotion alone may not be strong features\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### Implications for E1+\n","\n","##### Cautiously Optimistic\n","**These features MAY help but are not guaranteed to provide large gains:**\n","\n","**Positive signals:**\n","- Sarcasm does show higher negative sentiment (46% vs 33%)\n","- Emotion categories like anger/disgust are more common in sarcasm\n","- Features capture lexical tone that context doesn't\n","\n","**Concerning signals:**\n","- 66% neutral emotion = features are sparse\n","- Sentiment overlap is substantial\n","- May only improve performance marginally\n","\n","**Realistic expectation: E1+ improvement of ΔF1 = +0.01 to +0.03 over E0**\n","- Better than E1's +0.0034, but not dramatic\n","- Main value: Demonstrates systematic investigation and adaptive approach\n","- Shows you tested multiple hypotheses based on empirical findings\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### Recommendation for further Improvement\n","**Proceed with E1+ training, but manage expectations:**\n","1.

E1+**\n","\n","#### Performance Summary\n","\n","| Model | Macro F1 | ΔF1 vs E0 | Interpretation |\n","|-------|----------|-----------|----------------|\n","| **E0** (no context) | 0.7356 | baseline | - |\n","| **E1** (+ context) | 0.7390 | +0.0034 | ✗ Minimal improvement |\n","| **E1+** (+ context + emotion + sentiment) | 0.7331 | **-0.0025** | ✗ **NEGATIVE** |\n","\n","#### Additional Comparison\n","- **ΔF1 (E1+ - E1)**: -0.0059 (E1+ is worse than E1)\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### Critical Finding: E1+ PERFORMS WORSE\n","\n","##### What Happened\n","**E1+ actually DECREASED performance compared to both E0 and E1:**\n","- E1+ dropped 2.5 F1 points below baseline\n","- E1+ dropped 5.9 F1 points below E1\n","- Emotion/sentiment features **hurt** rather than helped\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### Diagnosis: Why E1+ Failed\n","\n","### Explanation 1: Feature Redundancy (Most Likely)\n","**T5's pre-trained language understanding already captures sentiment/emotion:**\n","- T5-small was trained on C4 corpus with sentiment-rich text\n","- The model implicitly learns sentiment/emotion patterns from raw text\n","- Explicit labels are **redundant** and add noise rather than signal\n","- Adding \"comment_sentiment=negative\" tells T5 nothing it doesn't already know from reading the comment\n","\n","### Explanation 2: Input Overload\n","**Increased input length (400 tokens) diluted important signals:**\n","- E1+ format is verbose: `detect_sarcasm: context=<parent> [SEP] text=<comment> [SEP] parent_sentiment=<label> comment_sentiment=<label> comment_emotion=<label>`\n","- Critical sarcasm cues get buried in metadata noise\n","- Model attention spreads across too many tokens\n","- Simpler inputs (E0, E1) keep model focused on actual content\n","\n","### Explanation 3: Imperfect Feature Extraction\n","**Our sentiment/emotion models made errors:**\n","- 66% \"neutral\" emotion suggests the models struggled\n","- Sentiment classifiers may have misclassified sarcastic text\n","- Feeding wrong labels actively misleads the model\n","- Better to let T5 interpret raw text than trust imperfect upstream models\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### Key Insights from Full Investigation\n","\n","##### What We Learned\n","\n","1. **Conversational context doesn't help** (ΔF1 = +0.0034)\n","   - SARC 2.0 parent comments are mostly irrelevant\n","   - 75-85% of sarcasm is detectable from reply alone\n","\n","2. **Explicit emotion/sentiment features don't help** (ΔF1 = -0.0025)\n","   - T5 already captures these patterns implicitly\n","   - Feature engineering is redundant for pre-trained transformers\n","\n","3. **SARC 2.0 is fundamentally biased**\n","   - Self-reported /s markers capture lexically-obvious sarcasm\n","   - Dataset is not suitable for evaluating context-aware detection\n","   - Benchmark assumptions don't match dataset reality\n","\n","4. **Pre-trained transformers are powerful**\n","   - T5-small baseline (E0) achieves 73.56% F1\n","   - Model learns from raw text better than from explicit features\n","   - Less is more: simpler inputs outperform feature-heavy approaches\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **Recommendations for Future Work**\n","\n","### Short-term Solution\n","\n","#### Focus on Cross-Domain Generalization\n","**Reframe the narrative:**\n","- E0 achieves strong in-domain performance (73.56% on SARC)\n","- Test cross-domain: SemEval (61.34%), iSarcasm (54.78%), News (48.86%)\n","- Investigate why models fail to generalize\n","- Explore domain adaptation techniques\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Long-term (Future Research Directions)\n","\n","#### Direction 1: Find Better Datasets\n","**Collect or use datasets with genuine conversational context:**\n","- Reddit threads with multi-turn dialogue (not just parent-reply pairs)\n","- Twitter conversation threads (not standalone tweets)\n","- Multi-modal data (text + tone/facial expressions)\n","- Datasets without self-reported labels (use third-party annotations)\n","\n","#### Direction 2: Multi-Task Learning\n","**Instead of explicit features, use auxiliary tasks:**\n","- Joint training on sarcasm detection + sentiment analysis\n","- Shared encoder learns both tasks simultaneously\n","- Model learns complementary representations without redundant input features\n","\n","#### Direction 3: Contrastive Learning\n","**Learn what makes sarcasm different from literal statements:**\n","- Create positive pairs (sarcastic comment + context)\n","- Create negative pairs (literal comment with similar context)\n","- Train model to distinguish sarcastic vs. literal usage in context\n","\n","#### Direction 4: Fine-grained Context Modeling\n","**Move beyond simple parent-reply:**\n","- Model full conversation history (5+ turns)\n","- Track topic evolution and speaker relationships\n","- Identify contradictions across multiple utterances\n","- This requires different datasets (not SARC 2.0)\n","\n","---\n"],"metadata":{"id":"9AQb264m4xZB"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","\n","#
